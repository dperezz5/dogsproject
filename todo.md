# DogSwipe Project: Step-by-Step Roadmap To-Do List

This roadmap breaks down the entire DogSwipe project into manageable tasks. The AI agent should execute only one specific task at a time. Once a task is completed and verified, the agent proceeds to the next step.

---

## Overview

- **Objective:** Build the DogSwipe web app with a React frontend, Node.js/Express backend, and Firebase for authentication.
- **Execution:** Follow the steps in order. Each task must be completed before moving on.

---

## Tasks

### 1. Project Setup & Environment Configuration
- [ ] **Setup Git Repository:**  
  - Initialize a Git repository and create an initial commit.
- [ ] **Environment Setup:**  
  - Create configuration files for the project.
- [ ] **Configure Firebase Project:**  
  - Set up Firebase project for authentication and database.
- [ ] **Containerization:**  
  - Create Dockerfiles and required configuration scripts for containerizing the backend and (if needed) the frontend.

*Instruction to AI: Execute step 1 only and verify project structure is set up properly.*

---

### 2. Backend Setup with Node.js & Express
- [ ] **Initialize Backend Project:**  
  - Set up a new Node.js project using `npm init` or similar tools.
- [ ] **Install Dependencies:**  
  - Install Express, Firebase Admin SDK, and other necessary packages.
- [ ] **Configure Express Server:**  
  - Set up a basic Express server with initial route handling.
- [ ] **Integrate Firebase Admin SDK:**  
  - Configure middleware to validate Firebase ID Tokens for every incoming request.

*Instruction to AI: Complete the backend setup tasks. Only proceed once the initial server is running and token validation is in place.*

---

### 3. Frontend Setup with React
- [ ] **Initialize React Project:**  
  - Use Create React App or a similar tool to initialize the React project.
- [ ] **Routing Setup:**  
  - Implement React Router for single-page application (SPA) navigation.
- [ ] **Firebase SDK Integration:**  
  - Integrate the Firebase SDK for handling user authentication.
- [ ] **Create Core Components:**  
  - Develop base components (e.g., Header, Footer, Dashboard) for initial layout.

*Instruction to AI: Set up and verify the initial React project and component structure, then move to the next task.*

---

### 4. API Development & Endpoints
- [ ] **User Endpoints:**  
  - Develop endpoints for retrieving, updating, and deleting user profiles.
- [ ] **Dog Profile Endpoints:**  
  - Create endpoints to add, view, update, and delete dog profiles.
- [ ] **Swipe & Match Endpoints:**  
  - Build endpoints to record swipe actions and create match records.
- [ ] **Testing Endpoints:**  
  - Test all API endpoints using Postman or any similar API testing tool.

*Instruction to AI: Work on the API endpoints one by one. Verify each endpoint before proceeding.*

---

### 5. UI/UX Design Implementation
- [ ] **Design Landing Page & Dashboard:**  
  - Implement the landing page with clear call-to-action buttons for login/registration.
- [ ] **Develop Swipe Card Component:**  
  - Create a swipe card component for displaying dog profiles.
- [ ] **Build Match & Messaging Interface:**  
  - Develop the interface to display matches and (optionally) a basic messaging system.
- [ ] **Responsive & Accessible Design:**  
  - Ensure designs are responsive and accessible (using semantic HTML and ARIA attributes).

*Instruction to AI: Focus on designing and building each component. Complete this task before moving on to the testing phase.*

---

### 6. Testing & Quality Assurance
- [ ] **Unit Testing - Backend:**  
  - Write unit tests for API endpoints using Jest or Mocha/Chai.
- [ ] **Unit Testing - Frontend:**  
  - Develop unit tests for React components using Jest and React Testing Library.
- [ ] **Integration & End-to-End Testing:**  
  - Implement integration and E2E tests with Cypress or Selenium.
- [ ] **Performance Testing:**  
  - Perform load and stress testing on the API and frontend.

*Instruction to AI: Complete testing for both backend and frontend components. Ensure quality before deploying.*

---

### 7. Deployment & CI/CD Setup
- [ ] **CI/CD Pipeline Configuration:**  
  - Set up automated pipelines (using GitHub Actions, Jenkins, etc.) for building, testing, and deploying the code.
- [ ] **Deployment:**  
  - Deploy the application after thorough testing and verification.
- [ ] **Monitoring & Logging:**  
  - Set up monitoring (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana) and logging systems.

*Instruction to AI: Follow these deployment steps in sequence and update the CI/CD pipelines accordingly.*

---

### 8. Documentation & Final Review
- [ ] **API Documentation:**  
  - Update and refine the API documentation.
- [ ] **User & Developer Documentation:**  
  - Create documentation for environment setup, deployment, and development processes.
- [ ] **Final Code & Security Review:**  
  - Perform a final review of the code base and run security audits.
- [ ] **Prepare Release Notes:**  
  - Compile release notes for deployment.

*Instruction to AI: Finalize and verify all documentation. Submit for final review before the official launch.*

---

## Specific Task Execution Strategy

- **Single Task Focus:**  
  Always begin with the first incomplete task from the list and complete it fully before moving on.
- **Verification:**  
  After each task, verify functionality and gather feedback before executing the next task.
- **Step-by-Step Instructions:**  
  When instructing the AI agent, provide the task number and specific instruction, e.g., "Please complete Task 1.2: Environment Setup."
